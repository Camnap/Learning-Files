<h2>Mandarin Chinese Restaurants</h2>
    <p>2206 Eglinton Ave East</p>
    <p> Toronto ON </p>
<h3>The Review</h3>
    <p> Mandarin has all of the usual Chinese dishes you would expect, but they also have a very generous selection of other dishes such as a Roast Beef and Pizza, and they do a good job with those as well. Lots of good desserts and many outlets over the Southern Ontario area. </p>
